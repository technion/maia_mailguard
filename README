This version of maia has been tested on the Centos 7 target platform, 
It should work on SLES, SuSe or Debian-based dstros, but the initial
focus is rather RHEL/Centos 7 specific. Scripts to install this
mailguard release on other Linux distros would be happily accepted.
In the meantime, it can be installed on other distros using a manual 
procedure.

Instructions: (this will evolve as we test and refine the process)

For Centos 7, run the script "install-centos7.sh"

For ubuntu 14.04 LTS, run the script "install-ubuntu-tt.sh"

For all other distros, one can puzzle through the manual procedure in the
contrib directory, which, though written for maia 1.0.2, which used
amavisd-new, replaced by maiad in the current version, still contains
the gist of what is needed. It will eventually be brought up to date
as well. Contributions are welcome.
