In some installs everything seemed to work except for the ability of users to
log in (typically the user created by internal-init.php, but changing the 
password with a mysql statement didn't work either, nor did copying an
encrypted password field from the same user on an identical machine where
maia mailguard was working normally.

The error was of the form:

Login for user failed. ( Possible case mixup rejected. Ask your system administrator about upper/lower case issues. )

Many things were tried, to no effect, dropping indexes per 
  http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.mail.virus.maiamailguard/15106
etc -

A quick and dirty solution was found:
drop the maia database, recreate it with the maia-mysql.sql file, and
run internal-init.php: success.

The reason it happened was that the user created with intrnal-init.php was
deleted from the maia_users table, damaging the integrity of the schema. 
If a user must be removed, use maiadbtool.pl, which will maintain the
integrity of the database.
